# CS162A

Course Description

CS 161A introduces computer programming through the development of programs using a high-level programming language. Explores foundational programming styles, techniques, syntax, and tools in order to develop, write, run, and debug simple computer programs with an emphasis on problem-solving. Surveys current social and ethical aspects of computer science.

Intended Outcomes for the Course
  Develop simple programming algorithms to solve computing problems.
  Implement the algorithms by writing programs that meet user requirements.
  Construct appropriate user interfaces and develop test plans for the correctness of programs.
  Identify and correct syntax errors.
  Apply logical skills to construct efficient and effective algorithms.
  Effectively use software development tools.


Programming Assignments
  There will be 8 programming assignments through this term. Each programming assignment consists of an Algorithmic Design Document and a C++ program (code). Your      submissions will be graded according to the Assignment Rubric; you can grade your own work and determine what grade to expect before submitting. For each assignment    you submit, you will be required to answer a question that asks you to think about your learning - each assignment will have a different question to answer! Please   post the answer to the submission question in the comments box when submitting your assignment to D2L.

  Algorithmic Design Document: Before beginning any programming assignment, it is important to plan! You will be planning out the logic in pseudocode or flowcharts and starting with the end in mind, what the user will see when they run your program. Your design document will guide you by starting with the end and then planning the logic by thinking about the program inputs, outputs, calculations, and the steps to solve the problem. You will submit a DRAFT of your design document by Wednesday for feedback. Remember, feedback is always meant to help you improve - I have high expectations, and I know you can do it!

  C++ Program (Code): After you have completed your planning document, you are ready to write your C++ program! You have already worked through the logic, and now you have to translate those steps into something the computer can understand. This is where you will be learning the rules, called syntax, of the C++ language - and there are a lot of rules to follow! Learning the rules takes A LOT of practice, and it can take some time before it clicks. Do your best and submit your work on time for feedback or help. You can always re-submit work as many times as needed to get the grade you want. Assignments are due by Sunday of each week.
